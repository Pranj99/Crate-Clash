# Crate-Clash
 
In this project, I developed a game in Unity designed to test the player's reflexes. The objective is for players to click and destroy objects that are randomly tossed in the air before they fall off the screen. As part of the development, I implemented a User Interface (UI) that enhances the overall gameplay experience. I added a title screen with a difficulty selection menu, allowing players to choose how challenging they want the game to be. I also included a score display to track points earned and a Game Over screen that gives players the option to restart and try again. This project allowed me to create a fully playable experience from start to finish without needing to restart the application to replay.
